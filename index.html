Description: This assignment was to create a part of a Scrabble game. At start, the website generates 7 random tiles that the user can drag and drop onto a Scrabble board row. When the user drags and drops the tile onto the board row, it becomes undraggable. The user has to try to form a word that is found in the dictionary array in "script.js", and if they are able to, it adds to their score. The tiles used so far and their values are stored in a data structure also in "script.js". The user can press "Next word" to submit their word and if it is valid, it will generate 7 new tiles and remove whatever is currently on the board. The user can also restart the game, which will set the number of tiles remaining to the default amount when starting a game for the first time. For this assignment, I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the design, and JavaScript along with jQuery for the drag and drop feature.
